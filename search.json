Some of these files contain settings related to the blog, while other contains data. The files most important include:\n\n_quarto.yml - Defines how the blog will be rendered.\nindex.qmd - Defines the content of your blog landing page.\nstyles.css - Defines the theme.\n\nYou might also notice a folder called posts/.

Lets delete those and create our own post.\nAfter deleting the example blog posts, create a new folder called \"first-blog-post\". Inside this folder create a .qmd file called index.qmd. Your folders should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosts folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst-blog-post folder\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can open the index.qmd file and start writing our first blog post.\nAt the very top, we need to define some post metadata in the form of YAML. We want to define a title, description, author, date, and categories. Lets add the following to our index.qmd.\n---\ntitle: \"My first blog post\"\ndescription: \"My first blog post using Quarto\"\nauthor: \"Anders Askeland\"\ndate: last-modified\ncategories: \n  - blog\n  - first\n---\nNow we need to write our actual text body. To write our text body, we will write using Markdown, a simple and easy to use markup language.\nLets add the following text body.\n---\ntitle: \"My first blog post\"\ndescription: \"My first blog post using Quarto\"\nauthor: \"Anders Askeland\"\ndate: last-modified\ncategories: \n  - blog\n  - first\n---\n\n# My first blog post\n\nThis is my first blog post.\n\nRender the blog\nUp until now, we have only been working in files and folders. But, how do we actually create a blog? This is where Quarto as a static site generate comes in, where we can use Quarto to automatically render us a blog website.\nTo render our blog into a website we can press the render button at the top of any index.qmd file in the main blog directory.\n\n\n\nRender blog post\n\n\nWhen having render the blog, the landing page should look like this:\n\n\n\nLanding page to website\n\n\nWhen viewing our blog post we should see:\n\n\n\nBlog post on website"
